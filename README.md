# OL490_Experiments
VB.NET. An experiment suite for Optronics Laboratories OL490 Agile Light Source experiments. Requires the hardware, but SDKs are included.
Portions were used for data collection in multiple experiments, including O'Neil, McDermott, Mizokami, Werner, Crognale, & Webster (2012) Journal of the Optical Society of America A. 29(2) A165-A173. Coding was done 100% by O'Neil.
Note: this is an early experiment so does not represent current coding, and has been used for multiple experiments so it's clunky.

Experiments and capabilities include:
1) Test Mode. display a variety of stimuli on the OL490, used for demos, calibration, measurement of output. Stimuli include:
2) Abney experiment. The Abney effect occurs where perceived hue of certain lights can appear to shift desaturated. Precise control of wavelength and saturation demonstrated the situations where this might occur.
3) Unique Hues. Quantify an person's unique or ideal given color, e.g. unique green = the purest green with minimal blue or yellow. This varies among individuals.
4) Natural spectra: display complex light spectra based on a measured light or object reflectance.
5) Flicker photometry: a technique where the optical density of the eye's macular pigment via rapidly flickering light stimuli.
